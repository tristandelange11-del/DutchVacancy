# DutchVacancy

Job platform connecting international students in the
Netherlands with employers that hire in English.
Full spec: memory/SPEC.md (read this first).

## Stack
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB (motor), all routes under /api
- Frontend: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript strict + Tailwind v4 + shadcn
- Auth: httpOnly session cookie (dv_session)
- Email: Resend. Payments: Stripe Checkout (Fresh Vacancy)
- Deploy: GitHub Actions to staging and production (Docker compose, Caddy)

## Structure
- backend/: server.py, routers/, models/schemas.py, lib/, tests/
- frontend/src/: pages, components, lib/types.ts
- memory/SPEC.md: living spec, data model and endpoints

## Rules
- NEVER run backend/seed.py against staging or production. It wipes the database.
- NEVER commit .env files, API keys or passwords.
- Always work on a separate branch. Never push directly to main.
- Keep frontend/src/lib/types.ts in sync with backend/models/schemas.py.
- Update memory/SPEC.md when the data model, endpoints or routes change.
- Keep changes small and focused on the task. Ask before adding new packages.
- Run the backend tests before finishing a task.

## Current focus
Interview scheduling: when an employer sets an application to
status "interview", the candidate gets a link to pick a time slot
(online or on location).
